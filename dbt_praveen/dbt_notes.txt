dbt_project.yml
Every dbt project includes a project configuration file called dbt_project.yml. 
It defines the directory of the dbt project and other project configurations.
--------------
Configurations are "model settings" that can be set in your dbt_project.yml 
file, and in your model file using a config block
--------------
materialization
dbt ships with five materializations: view, table, incremental, ephemeral and materialized_view
View
When using the view materialization, your model is rebuilt as a view on each run, via a create view as statement.
Table
When using the table materialization, your model is rebuilt as a table on each run, via a create table as statement.
Incremental
incremental models allow dbt to insert or update records into a table since the last time that model was run.
Ephemeral
ephemeral models are not directly built into the database. Instead, dbt will interpolate the code from this model into dependent models as a common table expression.
Materialized View
The materialized view materialization allows the creation and maintenance of materialized views in the target database. 
Materialized views are a combination of a view and a table, and serve use cases similar to incremental models.

snapshots
used for scd-2
seeds
used to create a static table in the target with the csv file present in dbt repo
tests
used to do unit testing

jinjas
using jinjas we can use if and for loops
use env variables
Return a list of columns
